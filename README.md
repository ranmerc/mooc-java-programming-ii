# Java Programming Part I

Herein lies my solution code for exercises in mooc.fi's [Java Programming Part II](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-2). Notes on [Notion](https://ranmerc.notion.site/Java-Notes-II-706e73b3383545269bcce4873bd0c03a).

Only did only till Part 12 because the last two parts are based on JavaFX, which I have no intention of and need to learn at this moment.
